# QRatitude Inventory System
QRatitude is an inventory management system consisting of:
* an Android app for scanning QR codes (encoded psuedo-GUIDs) and uploading associated product data
* a Node.js web service that exposes an API to store and query the product data
* (coming soon) a website front-end that consumes the API
